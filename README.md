# School_District_Analysis
Writing this here bc the beginning of the challenge for mod 4 says "Deliverable 6: A written analysis of your results (README.md)."

Yet at the end of the challenge Deliverable 6: Report Findings (5 points) states; In a few sentences, an understanding of the performed analysis is demonstrated. (5 points)
And that is repeated in that actual Student_Data_Stater_code.ipynb file. 

So let me know if I need to fill this puppy out :)
